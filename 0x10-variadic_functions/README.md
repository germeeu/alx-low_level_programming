The project that test my knowledge of variadic functions in C languages
during the studies of a **Full stack software Engineering** at ALX School.

## **Technologies used are :**
- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## These are the Files written in C:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th> Filenames</th>
  		<th> Descriptions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 0-sum_them_all.c </td>
		<td>  Returns the sum of all its parameters </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 1-print_numbers.c </td>
		 <td>  Prints numbers with seperators </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 2-print_strings.c </td>
		<td> Prints strings with seperators </td>
