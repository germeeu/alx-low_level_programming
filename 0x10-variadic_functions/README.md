# **Variadic functions**

The project that test my knowledge of variadic functions in C languages
during the studies of a **Full stack software Engineering** at ALX School.

## **Technologies used are :**
- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## These are the Files written in C:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th> Filenames </th>
  		<th> Descriptions </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> 0-sum_them_all.c </th>
		<th>  Returns the sum of all its parameters </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> 1-print_numbers.c </th>
		 <th>  Prints numbers with seperators </th>
	</tr>
| Filenames  | Descriptions |
| 0-sum_them_all.c | Returns the sum of all its parameters |
| 1-print_numbers.c | Prints numbers with seperators |
| 2-print_strings.c | Prints strings with seperators |
| 3-print_all.c | Prints anything |
