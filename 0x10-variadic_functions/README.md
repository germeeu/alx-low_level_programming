The project that test my knowledge of variadic functions in C languages
during the studies of a **Full stack software Engineering** at ALX School.

## **Technologies used are :**
- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4

- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## These are the Files written in C:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th> **Filenames** </th>
  		<th> **Descriptions** </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> 0-sum_them_all.c </th>
		<th>  Returns the sum of all its parameters </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		 <th>  Prints numbers with seperators </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> 2-print_strings.c </th>
